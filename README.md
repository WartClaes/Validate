# Validate



Validate is a easy to use validation script build with jQuery.

How easy to use? Just like this:

	$('#foo').validate();
	


## Does it have any options?

Yes
  

## Which ones?

#### eclass
This way you can edit the class on the errored elements.

**Default** we set it to **'error'**, obviously, but if you want 'orange', 'penguin' or even something else than those two, this is the way to do it.



#### wrapper
You can set a wrapper element in which the error will show. **Default** we have **none** set, so it's all up to you.


#### addClass
And now you are thinking "I don't want any class, I'll do it myself!". Okay, just turn them off with the **addClass boolean**.



## Any callbacks?
Again, yes. It is here and it works and it's optional.
And as a gift we give you ........... the **data** with the combined field and errors.

You're welcome.
